# OctaveDifferentiation

There are multiple factors affecting the sound produced by an instrument, some of them being the pitch or timbre, frequency, the make of the instrument and so on. We have restricted our scope to frequency band distinction for recognition. Our project differentiates between 2 octaves of the D note of a piano.

The system has been designed TMS320C6713 DSP based DSK6713 kit (hardware implementation).
